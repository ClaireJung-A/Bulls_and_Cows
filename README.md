# Bulls_and_Cows
Bulls and Cows Game (using Genetic Algorithm)

- In the Bulls and Cows Game, Player 1 provides a sequence of digits from 0 to 9, which is the solution. Player 2 then writes down a guess. Player 1 will assign a score to the guess based on the number of "Bulls" and "Cows" in the guess.
- A "Bull" is a digit that is the correct value and in the correct position.
- A "Cow" is a digit that is the correct value but in the wrong position.
- Based on the score given by Player 1, Player 2 will either win the game since they guessed the solution, or they will keep guessing and getting a score back from Player 2 until they guess the correct number.
